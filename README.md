## officially for real saving the world this time (actually)

https://tbfrobinson.github.io/Project_1/

(working title) follows some guy who gets his turn to save the world. Drawing inspiration from 'I wanna be the guy' and 'I wanna be the boshy', (working title) is a cheeky precision platformer with a boss fight.


## MVP
- Start screen, digital art mountain, start button, options (mute sfx music)
- Render player  with jumping, arrow key movement, and a shooting button
- Create platforms
- death screen, makes fun of the player?
- respawn in room
- Screen 1: basic controls, instructed by bird to climb the mountain
- Victory screen for making it across the screen! Credits?

## Stretch Goals
- Screen 2: the climb, precision platforming with instant death around
- Screen 3: Fight. rocks rain down as something destroys crust of volcano? 
- saws, rocks, maybe lava for the boss
- basic sound effects for dying and winning
- Pretty Backgrounds
- Music and sound effects
- Another room maybe, either with NPCs to talk to or more platforming
- Undertale like interactions or cutscenes
