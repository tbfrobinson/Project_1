# THE Official Saving the World Video Game tm real
## officially for real saving the world this time (actually)

Atlas has lost his head, head up the mountain to save the world and your head!

https://tbfrobinson.github.io/Project_1/

## Approach and technologies
### 'we have the technology'
- Javascript canvas
- class based character construction
- not module based
- keydown and keyup events to move the chacter left and right
- advancing sprite sheet through keydown events
- messy audio files strewn about index.js
- brute force


## MVP
- Start screen, digital art mountain, start button, options (mute sfx music)
- Render player  with jumping, arrow key movement
- death screen, makes fun of the player?
- respawn in room
- Screen 1: basic controls, instructed by bird to climb the mountain
- Victory screen for making it across the screen! Credits?

## Stretch Goals
- Screen 2: the climb, precision platforming with instant death around
- Screen 3: Fight. rocks rain down as something destroys crust of volcano? 
- saws, rocks, maybe lava for the boss
- basic sound effects for dying and winning
- Pretty Backgrounds
- Music and sound effects
- Another room maybe, either with NPCs to talk to or more platforming
- Undertale like interactions or cutscenes


## Reflection 
- Need to better plan file structure
- I think that modules seem helpful for separating javascript
- Need to use arrays more, arrays for collision, arrays for bullets, arrays for levels to advance through.
- video games have talking to things as a keydown usually, that would be a lot better than putting text on the screen if the chacter is within a certain x range
- is stopping the animation ever a good idea?
